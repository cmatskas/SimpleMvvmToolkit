To get started with Simple Mvvm Toolkit, follow the step-by-step instructions
listed in the Documentation section of the project web site on CodePlex:
http://simplemvvmtoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Getting%20Started.

The toolkit supports creating applications using the Model-View-ViewModel
design pattern which target a number of platforms:
- Windows Presentation Foundation
- Silverlight
- Windows Store
- Windows Phone
- iOS (Xamarin)
- Android (Xamarin)

You can also create Portable Class Libraries with models and view models
that can be referenced by any of the frameworks listed above.

To aid development of MVVM applications, the toolkit includes a number
of Visual Studio item and project templates, as well as a set of C# code 
snippets and Xml snippets for use with XAML. And there is a set of helper
classes deployed in a NuGet package.

There are also screencasts listed here that you can watch to learn how
to create your first project using the Simple Mvvm Toolkit.
